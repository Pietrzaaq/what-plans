I planned this project to be a fullstack web application with map on wich you could see upcoming events in your chosen city, and easily signed to them, add to calendar or maybe even buy tickets




## Planned features 

- Users can choose or find a city and view it on the map with upcoming events such as cultural, sports, etc.

- Users can view details of that event, including the date and time, exact address, and the possibility to be redirected to Google Maps

- Users can register using username and password but also using Google OAuth

- Signed users can add events on the map

- A job that would be able to fetch events in specific areas, possibly by using available APIs or web scraping

- To be continued...
